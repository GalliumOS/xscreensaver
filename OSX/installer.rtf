This will install all of the screen savers system-wide. 
If you prefer, you can instead install them one at a time by opening 
the \i "Screen Savers" \i0 folder in this disk image and double-clicking 
on only the ones that you want.\
\
The full installation will take around 160 MB.\
\
Please visit the 
{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/"}}{\fldrslt \cf2 \ul \ulc2 XScreenSaver web site}}. 
The XScreenSaver collection is free software, and all source code 
is available there.\
\
