.SH NAME
xscreensaver-getimage-video - put a video frame on the root window
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xscreensaver-getimage-video
[\-display \fIhost:display.screen\fP] [\--verbose] [\--stdout]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIxscreensaver\-getimage\-video\fP program is a helper program
for the xscreensaver hacks that manipulate images.  Specifically, it
is invoked by
.BR xscreensaver\-getimage (1)
as needed.  This is not a user-level command.

This program grabs a random frame of video from the system's video input,
and then loads it on the root window.  It does this by figuring out which
frame-grabbing programs are installed on the system, and invoking the
first one it finds.   Then it runs
.BR xscreensaver\-getimage\-file (1)
to load that image onto the root window.
.SH OPTIONS
.I xscreensaver-getimage-video
accepts the following options:
.TP 4
.B --verbose
Print diagnostics.
.TP 4
.B --stdout
Instead of loading the image onto the root window, write it to stdout
as a PBM file.
