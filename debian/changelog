  * fixed manpage of boxed, closes: #244786
  * fixed manpage of glsnake, closes: #222833
  * 4.20 upstream closes even more bugs, closes: #279982
  * made ISO 8601 time format the default, closes: #279982, #299890
  * Debian has /etc/alternatives which the Gnome and KDE packages use
    Thus XScreensaver should use x-www-browser and x-terminal-emulator
    instead of gnome-terminal and the like, closes: #300285, #276648
  * No more typos in configure.in, closes: #134722
  * Fix in upstream: as of xscreensaver 4.18, if it can't grab both the keyboard and
    mouse, it does not blank the screen.  This means that if you are
    running rdesktop or some long-keyboard-grabbing program, xscreensaver
    will never lock your screen until that grab is released.
    This is still bad, obviously, but perhaps it will confuse people less,
    and -- perhaps -- failing to lock at all is less bad than accidentally
    typing passwords at the wrong window, closes: #105995
