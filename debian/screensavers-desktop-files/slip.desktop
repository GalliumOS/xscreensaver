Comment=This throws some random bits on the screen, then sucks them through a jet engine and spews them out the other side. To avoid turning the image completely to mush, every now and then it will it interject some splashes of color into the scene, or go into a spin cycle, or stretch the image like taffy. Written by Scott Draves and Jamie Zawinski.
